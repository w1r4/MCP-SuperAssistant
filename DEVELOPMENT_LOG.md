### M365 Copilot Auto-Attachment Implementation

**Date:** December 2024

#### What We Did

1. **Added M365 Copilot Support to Auto-Attachment System**
   - Implemented automatic file attachment for Microsoft 365 Copilot when responses exceed character limits
   - Added new constants:
     - `MAX_INSERT_LENGTH_M365_COPILOT = 8000` (initially 4000, increased to 8000)
     - `WEBSITE_NAME_FOR_M365_COPILOT_CHECK = ['m365copilot']`

2. **Enhanced Auto-Attachment Logic**
   - Modified two key locations in `components.ts` to include M365 Copilot checks
   - Implemented dynamic limit detection based on platform
   - Added intelligent switching between Perplexity (39,000 chars) and M365 Copilot (8,000 chars) limits

3. **Fixed Character Limit Issues**
   - Resolved auto-attachment not triggering for M365 Copilot responses
   - Increased character limit from 4,000 to 8,000 based on user feedback and testing
   - Ensured seamless user experience without manual intervention

#### Technical Implementation

```typescript
// Auto-attachment logic checks both platforms
const shouldAttachAsFile = 
  (rawResultText.length > MAX_INSERT_LENGTH && WEBSITE_NAME_FOR_MAX_INSERT_LENGTH_CHECK.includes(websiteName)) ||
  (rawResultText.length > MAX_INSERT_LENGTH_M365_COPILOT && WEBSITE_NAME_FOR_M365_COPILOT_CHECK.includes(websiteName));
```

#### Benefits Achieved

- **Seamless User Experience**: No manual file attachment needed for large responses
- **Platform-Aware**: Different limits for different platforms based on their constraints
- **Consistent Behavior**: Similar functionality to existing Perplexity integration
- **Intelligent Switching**: Automatic detection and appropriate handling

## Next Steps & TODO

### High Priority

1. **Configuration Management**
   - [ ] Move character limits to a configuration file for easier maintenance
   - [ ] Add environment-based configuration support
   - [ ] Create admin interface for adjusting limits without code changes

2. **Enhanced Platform Support**
   - [ ] Add support for other AI platforms (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.)
   - [ ] Research optimal character limits for each platform
   - [ ] Implement platform-specific attachment strategies

3. **User Experience Improvements**
   - [ ] Add visual indicators when auto-attachment occurs
   - [ ] Implement user preferences for attachment thresholds
   - [ ] Add option to preview content before attachment

### Medium Priority

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - [ ] Implement lazy loading for large content
   - [ ] Add content compression before attachment
   - [ ] Optimize DOM manipulation for better performance

5. **Error Handling & Monitoring**
   - [ ] Add comprehensive error logging for attachment failures
   - [ ] Implement retry mechanisms for failed attachments
   - [ ] Add analytics to track attachment usage patterns

6. **Testing & Quality Assurance**
   - [ ] Create automated tests for auto-attachment logic
   - [ ] Add integration tests for different platforms
   - [ ] Implement performance benchmarks

### Low Priority

7. **Advanced Features**
   - [ ] Smart content summarization for very large responses
   - [ ] Multiple file format support (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
   - [ ] Content categorization and tagging

8. **Documentation & Maintenance**
   - [ ] Create user documentation for auto-attachment features
   - [ ] Add developer documentation for extending platform support
   - [ ] Implement automated dependency updates

## Code Quality Suggestions

### Current Strengths
- Well-organized constant definitions
- Clear separation of concerns
- Performance optimizations with caching
- Consistent error handling patterns

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Configuration Externalization**
   ```typescript
   // Instead of hardcoded constants, use config
   const CONFIG = {
     platforms: {
       m365copilot: { maxLength: 8000, checkNames: ['m365copilot'] },
       perplexity: { maxLength: 39000, checkNames: ['perplexity'] }
     }
   };
   ```

2. **Type Safety Enhancement**
   ```typescript
   interface PlatformConfig {
     maxLength: number;
     checkNames: string[];
     supportedFormats?: string[];
   }
   ```

3. **Modular Architecture**
   - Extract auto-attachment logic into separate modules
   - Create platform-specific handlers
   - Implement plugin architecture for easy extension

4. **Enhanced Logging**
   ```typescript
   const logger = {
     debug: (msg: string, data?: any) => console.debug(`[AutoAttach] ${msg}`, data),
     warn: (msg: string, data?: any) => console.warn(`[AutoAttach] ${msg}`, data)
   };
   ```
